# Swift Tour Experiments
This repository contains my solutions to the experiments from the Swift Tour section of the Swift Programming Language book.

## Running the experiments
Each chapter with its associated experiments is in its own file within the Sources folder. To run a given chapter's experiments (for example, SimpleValues.swift), use the Swift command line tool:
```bash
cd Sources
swift SimpleValues.swift
```
